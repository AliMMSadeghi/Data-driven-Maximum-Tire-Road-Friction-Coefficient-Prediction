The maximum tire/road friction coefficient (TRFC) is vital for vehicle dynamics control systems. This project develops an algorithm to predict maximum TRFC using a multi-layer perceptron neural network (NN), trained on features from vertical accelerations due to road characteristics. Data was collected through vehicle tests on selected roads, measuring vertical acceleration and using wavelet transform to extract the four most significant features. Ground-truth TRFC data was obtained from hard braking maneuvers. This study provides a TRFC estimation algorithm based on vertical acceleration features, applicable in constant-speed driving conditions.
